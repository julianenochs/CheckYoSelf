### CheckYoSelf

## Overview:
CheckYoSelf is an application to create and store lists of tasks. In the sidebar of the app there are inputs to create checklists that can be reviewed and deleted before appending them to a card. From the card, tasks can be checked off and marked as urgent or deleted completely.

## Technical Overview:
CheckYoSelf was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overall Wins: 
Finishing the comp in CSS quickly was very helpful so I could focus on my javascript. Utilizing objects to store and access data was a great learning experience.


## Overall Struggles:
Time management was my main concern with this project.
